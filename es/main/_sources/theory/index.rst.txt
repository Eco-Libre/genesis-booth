#. Two large covered outdoor spaces for living & working

Concept
*******

Typically if someone buys land somewhere remote (off-grid & without utilities), they first bring-in diesel generators to power the tools needed to begin construction.

The "Genesis Booth" is an alternative that would permit constructing a new off-grid community or homestead using renewable, solar energy.

The expectation is that people move-in with camping gear. They purchase four 1 meter x 2 meter solar panels and spend their first weeks building the Genesis Booth. After the booth is complete, they have a weather-proof shed for storing tools, enough power for metal- and wood-working tools (`saws, drills, welder <https://wiki.opensourceecology.org/wiki/How_to_Build_the_4_Machines_in_a_Basic_Workshop>`_) and a covered workspace to continue construction (eg the `Eco-Libre Launch Nest <https://github.com/Eco-Libre/launch-nest>`_).
