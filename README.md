This is the first structure to be built when jumpstarting a new off-grid community. It provides the power, storage, and outdoor workshop space needed to build-out the community.

## Features

1. 4x PV Solar Panels on the roof
1. Electrical charge controller, batteries, inverter, etc
1. Large Individual storage lockers for volunteers' personal belongings
1. Ample shelf-space for tools
1. Two large covered outdoor spaces for living & working

## Concept

Typically if someone buys land somewhere remote (off-grid & without utilities), they first bring-in diesel generators to power the tools needed to begin construction.

The "Genesis Booth" is an alternative that would permit constructing a new off-grid community or homestead using renewable, solar energy.

The expectation is that people move-in with camping gear. They purchase four 1 meter x 2 meter solar panels and spend their first weeks building the Genesis Booth. After the booth is complete, they have a weather-proof shed for storing tools and a covered workspace to continue construction.
